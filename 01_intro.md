# What is SQL?

<!--sec 1.2-->
## Structured Query Language
- a declarative language used to grab data from a database

Note:
Declarative means you say what you want, not how to get it. We'll see examples of what this means later

# What is a database?

<!--sec 2.2-->
## Relational Database

![spreadsheet](images/spreadsheet.png)

Note:
When you hear "database" we're typically referring to a relational database, which can be visualized like a bunch of spreadsheets that reference each other

There are columns that say what the data means and rows for each entry

<!--sec 3.1-->
# What tools can I use?
- the command line using `sqlite3 <db_name>`
- a GUI like [TablePlus](https://tableplus.io/)
