RSpec is a Ruby testing framework

<!--sec 2.1-->
## what does a testing framework do?

<!--sec 2.2-->
Testing frameworks help us automate verifying functionality

<!--sec 3.1-->
## What kinds of tests are there?

<!--sec 3.2-->
- Unit
- Integration
- Acceptance

Note:
A unit test is used to test a single, isolated piece of functionality
An integration test is used to test a group of isolated functionality
  i.e. you want to test that a small subset of functionality works together
An acceptance test is used to test an entire path through the application
  i.e. User interface -> database
  Acceptance includes both feature and request specs
